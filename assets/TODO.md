1. Add an option in settings page to autostart captain-ballrd.(for wm, they should put an instruction in it's config file).
2. Only show status of projects in status window that have a file(changed, staged,..).
3. Seperate __GIT_STATUS_WT_NEW__ files and __GIT_STATUS_WT_MODIFIED__ files in each tab and users will `add` or `commit` changes from captain-ballard.
